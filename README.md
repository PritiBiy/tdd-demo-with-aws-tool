## TDD with AWS CodeWhisperer
AWS code whisperer could not generate the markdown content. 

## Problem statement 
The system should allow customers the following requirements in the order listed below:
- Add, remove and view items from the cart. When displaying the items we must see the name, price and quantity of the items.
- View the total price of the cart. It will keep updated after modifications on the cart.
- Increase and decrease the quantity of items in their cart.
- Add items with different options and prices. For example, a customer can add a bottle of water of 500ml or 1L. The price will vary based on the selected option.
- View the total price of their cart based on the store they are shopping from. For example, if I'm buying an item from the store in Spain, the price will be lower than if I'm buying the same item from the store in the UK.
